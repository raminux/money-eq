If money didn't restrict you, what would you do?
I do whatever I like to do at any time and any where. For example, I go with my family all
around the world. I make the earth a better place for every creature. I teach everyone
how to enjoy their lives. I help people to concentrate on adding value to the earth by
whatever they know, what they can do. Everyone has the ability to contribute to the whole
world. They just need a trigger. I am that trigger. I establish a company that everyone can
contribute to it. A company that respects every contributer's thought. A company without any
employee, instead a company full of contributors. I use my money to change the current situation
in the world.

Money is energy. There are two kinds of money namely, happy money and unhappy money.

2- Shyness,
3- Need to be seen as a good person.

the monetary value it offers.
3- Guilt, shyness, and the need to be seen as a good person can block the flow of money.
4- By the end of this quest, you'll feel less stress about money and start seeing it as a
friend.
